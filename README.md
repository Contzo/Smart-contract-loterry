# ðŸŽ° Smart Contract Lottery

This repository is a personal implementation of the [Cyfrin Foundry Smart Contract Lottery Course](https://github.com/Cyfrin/foundry-smart-contract-lottery-cu), using [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/) to build, test, and deploy a decentralized lottery smart contract.

## ðŸ§± What It Does

The lottery smart contract allows users to:
- Enter the lottery by paying a set entrance fee
- Automatically pick a random winner using Chainlink VRF
- Run on a scheduled interval using Chainlink Keepers (Automation)

It showcases integration with:
- âœ… Chainlink VRF v2.5 (for randomness)
- âœ… Chainlink Keepers / Automation
- âœ… Foundry framework for development and testing
